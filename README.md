#### <i class="icon-refresh"></i> Use those scripts

At the moment you can use :

-**add_colors.sh** (which add the atom color palette to your iTerm settings)

-**fix_brew.sh** (which fix brew)
> **Tip:** You can use `--keep` argument to prevent deleting your formulas :).

-**fix_fish.sh** (which fix fish)
> **Tip:** I made a pull request at fish repo, so in 2.3.2 it will be natively fixed.
> **Tip:** `echo "exec fish -l" >> .zshrc`.
